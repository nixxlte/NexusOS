Hi! this will be the last registry of NexusOS, at least on this repo.

FIRST: I want to thank everyone who belived the project, It's thanks to you that the announcement inside this .txt file was possible
a special thanks to @GiovaniFZ, @Lucmsilva651 and @im-Nassinger for helping me.

SECOND: NexusOS is not the first name of the project, hope i was clear, and now it has a final name.
this repo will be a archive of what I did in almost 1 year making this OS under the name of NexusOS

THIRD: The project will not be ended, it just will change a bit.¹

FINALLY: The final project name will be LuminOS, and the first open beta will be relased using KDE Plasma (instead of GNOME) as DE.
The first open beta of LuminOS will be relased in December, 2025, stay tuned for more news!

LuminOS will use C# for programs, instead of HTML in PWAs. Cause its more intuitive for me, and i think is better, and lighter than use Electron for any application instance.
So, System requirements will be lighter than NexusOS, specifically, it will use the Kubuntu system requirements as base,
cause Kubuntu is Ubuntu (Lumin's base) with Plasma (Lumin's DE). System requirements will be avaible on next news into my website
and will be added to LuminCORE GitHub repo's README.md file... soon

A speciall thanks for you all, and thanks for YOU to read this file.
See you on December, 2025, with LuminOS Open Beta 1!

1. LuminOS will use a different programming language for apps, and "KernelMod" is now the LuminSDK. More information about LuminSDK is already avaible on Lumin repo.
